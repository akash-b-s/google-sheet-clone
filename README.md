# Spreadsheet Web Application

## **Overview**
This project involves creating a dynamic web application that replicates key functionalities of a spreadsheet application, offering a robust platform for data manipulation and visualization. It includes essential features like cell-based data entry, formula processing, formatting options, and row/column management, all wrapped in an intuitive and interactive interface.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Interactive Spreadsheet Interface**
- **User-Friendly Design**: A grid-based layout with a toolbar and formula bar for ease of use.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Move content and formulas seamlessly between cells.
- **Cell Dependencies**: Automatic updates for dependent cells.
- **Basic Styling**: Options for bold, italics, font adjustments, and color changes.
- **Row and Column Management**: Add, remove, and resize dynamically.

### **2. Built-in Mathematical Functions**
- Perform common calculations such as:
  - `SUM`: Adds values in a range.
  - `AVERAGE`: Calculates the average.
  - `MAX`/`MIN`: Finds maximum or minimum values.
  - `COUNT`: Counts numerical entries.

### **3. Data Cleanup and Transformation**
- Functions to improve data quality:
  - `TRIM`: Removes unwanted spaces.
  - `UPPER`/`LOWER`: Adjusts text case.
  - `REMOVE_DUPLICATES`: Eliminates redundant entries.
  - `FIND_AND_REPLACE`: Locates and modifies text across cells.

### **4. Data Entry and Validation**
- Supports various data types like text, numbers, and dates.
- Basic input validation for improved accuracy.

### **5. Additional Features**
- **Save/Load**: Local storage integration for saving and retrieving spreadsheets.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs from spreadsheet data.
- **Formula Support**: Advanced formulas with absolute and relative references.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js**: For creating a responsive and modular UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent and efficient styling.

### **Backend** (Optional)
- **Node.js + Express**: For managing data storage and server operations.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: To persist data for advanced features.

### **Libraries**
- **React-DnD**: Implements drag-and-drop.
- **Chart.js/D3.js**: For graphical data representation.
- **Jest & Cypress**: Ensures reliable testing and bug-free deployment.

## **Core Implementation**

### **Data Structures**
1. **Grid**: A 2D array to store cell content and attributes.
2. **Dependency Tracker**: Adjacency list for tracking formula-based relationships.
3. **Formula Parser**: Converts expressions into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluation.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js installed on the system.

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spreadsheet-web-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd spreadsheet-web-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Launch the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Usage**

1. **Enter and Edit Data**: Select cells to input values or text.
2. **Apply Formulas**: Use the formula bar for expressions like `=SUM(A1:A5)`.
3. **Format**: Adjust cell styles via toolbar options.
4. **Row/Column Operations**: Easily modify the spreadsheet structure.
5. **Data Quality**: Test functions like `UPPER` or `REMOVE_DUPLICATES`.

## **Testing and Debugging**
- Execute unit tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Run end-to-end tests:
  ```bash
  npx cypress open
  ```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Cloud-based file saving and sharing.
- Real-time collaboration for multiple users.
- Advanced charting tools and interactive graphs.
- Enhanced formula support, including nested and custom functions.
